            <ul>
                <li>
                    The tiger has adapted to a great variety of environments, from the Siberian taiga, where nights can
                    be as cold as −40 °C (−40 °F), to the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans, where the temperatures
                    reach more than 40 °C (104 °F).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tigers haunt the ruins of buildings such as courts and temples and are at home in habitats ranging
                    from dry grassland to rainforest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grasslands, mixed grassland-forests, and deciduous rather than densely canopied forests support
                    maximum population densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of prey species.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having evolved in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant
                    of heat than other large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy
                    bathing. Under stress it may climb trees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The tiger usually hunts by night and preys on a variety of animals, but it prefers fairly large prey
                    such as deer (sambar, chital, and swamp deer) and wild pigs.
